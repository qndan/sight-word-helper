## Hotkeys
```js
Hide Word : 'H'
Mark Attempt : 'T'
```

## Tips
 - Press the big fire button to mark the current word as success and go to the next word.
 - You can press on a word in the word list to skip to it
 - Press `H` on your keyboard or the hide button on the side to hide the word for word games
 - Use mark attempt to help you keep track of words your student is struggling with
 - You can see words you marked as attempted by pressing the export button
 - Mark success will mark the current word as a success without going to the next word

## Export
The export button helps you keep track of words you marked as attempted.

The export format looks like this:
```
First Marked Attempt: List B
Last List: List B
we (1), no (1), he (2)
```
`First Marked Attempt` is the first word list where you marked the word as attempted.
`Last List` is the last list you got to. The rest is the words that were marked as attempted and the number of times they were marked as attempted in parentheses.
