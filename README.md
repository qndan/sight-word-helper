# Export
The export button helps you keep track of words you marked as attempted.

The export format looks like this:
```
First Marked Attempt: List B
Last List: List B
we (1), no (1), he (2)
```
`First Marked Attempt` is the first word list where you marked the word as attempted.
`Last List` is the last list you got to. The rest is the words that were marked as attempted and the number of times they were marked as attempted in parentheses.
